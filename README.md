# DataSerializer-
A library for serializing and deserializing objects of arbitrary classes into CSV format using reflection in C#. The project demonstrates the capabilities of reflection for working with data of any type, and also provides a comparison of the performance of a custom solution with popular standard serialization mechanisms such as Newtonsoft.Json.
